Zera supports multiple deployment methods, including Docker, Vercel, and traditional server deployment.

The project provides a ready-to-use Docker Compose configuration:

```bash
cd Docker
docker-compose up -d
```

version: '3.8'

```yaml
# Docker/docker-compose.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ../backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - ENV=production
    
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ../frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

The frontend can be directly deployed to Vercel:

1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set the build configuration:
   - **Framework Preset**: Vite
   - **Root Directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `dist`

The project already includes a `vercel.json` configuration file.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The build output is located in the `frontend/dist` directory and can be deployed to any static file server.

```bash
cd backend
go build -o server ./cmd/server
```

| Variable | Description | Default Value |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `PORT` | Server port | `8080` |
| `ENV` | Runtime environment | `development` |

The backend uses `config.toml` for configuration:

```toml
# backend/config.toml
[server]
port = 8080
host = "0.0.0.0"

[cors]
allowed_origins = ["*"]
```

Before deployment, please confirm the following:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Environment Variable Configuration
    Ensure all necessary environment variables are properly set
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### CORS Configuration
    In production, restrict allowed origins instead of using wildcards
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### HTTPS
    Ensure all traffic is protected with HTTPS
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    ### Logging and Monitoring
    Set up proper log collection and monitoring alerts
  </Step>
</Steps>

The documentation site is built with Next.js and can be deployed to Vercel:

```bash
cd docs
npm run build
```

or use the Vercel CLI:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

We recommend using GitHub Actions for automated deployment:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy-frontend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: cd frontend && npm ci && npm run build
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID }}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID }}
          working-directory: ./frontend

  deploy-backend:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.21'
      - run: cd backend && go build -o server ./cmd/server
